## Project Summary

The team is creating a dashboard to visualize data trends in the 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations dataset. This includes information about airports, airlines, destinations, and times of the year, which will be presented to users in the form of visualizations. Users will be able to input their preferred airport, destination or time of year and see trends related to flight delays. The dashboard will have two user groups: customers who can access the visualizations and airline employees who can log in and insert or update the data. The aim is to educate users through these trends and provide them with valuable information on how to minimize or avoid flight delays.
